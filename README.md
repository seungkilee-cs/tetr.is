Just writing Tetris with concurrency in Elixir

## About

A lightning-fast multiplayer Tetris implementation built with Elixir/Phoenix, leveraging OTP for massive concurrency and real-time gameplay.

## Tech Stack

- **Elixir/OTP** - Concurrent game logic
- **Phoenix Framework** - Web server and WebSockets
- **Phoenix LiveView** - Real-time UI
- **ETS** - High-performance state storage
- **MessagePack** - Binary protocol for minimal latency

## Getting Started

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
